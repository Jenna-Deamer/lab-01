    <h3>Growing Up</h3>
    <p>
        I was born in Newmarket Ontario, on <em>October 12th, 2004.</em> I spent about ten
        years living in Newmarket<br> with my mother and two older siblings. I moved
        to Barrie at the beginning of 7th grade<br> to be closer to other family
        members and post-secondary institutions.
    </p>
    <h3> Education & Achievements</h3>
    <p> I attended Innisdale secondary and graduated in June 2022. I mostly enjoyed my technology-related classes<br>
        such
        as the introduction to programming using Python. During a handful of my computer courses,<br> I was achieving
        above-average grades,<br> and I spent a lot of my time during some of these classes helping other students.
    </p>
    <h3> Future Goals</h3>
    <p>
        I chose to attend post-secondary to better prepare for a career related to computer programming.<br> I wanted to
        study computer programming because I enjoy working with computers and want to expand my knowledge.<br>
        Currently, I
        am unsure what specific field I would like to go into.<br> However, I hope to learn a lot about the different
        fields
        and find some that interest me.
