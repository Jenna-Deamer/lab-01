    <h3>Growing Up</h3>
    <p>
        I was born in Newmarket Ontario, on <em>October 12th, 2004.</em> I spent about ten
        years living in Newmarket with my mother and two older siblings. I moved
        to Barrie at the beginning of 7th grade to be closer to other family
        members and post-secondary institutions.
    </p>
    <h3> Education & Achievements</h3>
    <p> I attended Innisdale secondary and graduated in June 2022. I mostly enjoyed my technology-related classes such
        as the introduction to programming using Python. During a handful of my computer courses, I was achieving
        above-average grades, and I spent a lot of my time during some of these classes helping other students.
